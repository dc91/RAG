This code was written during the night, look out for misstakes!

```
pip install chromadb openai pymupdf4llm tiktoken tomlkit
```

checkSplitting.py checks how the splitting looks in normal text and markdown.

splitPDF.py is for creating and upserting a collection in chromadb, once you know your files are good.

More instructions incoming, but i tried to comment the code, so check it out and read the docs.
